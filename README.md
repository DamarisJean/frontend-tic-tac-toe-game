# Tic Tac Toe Game

Hey there! Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game project.
## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns marking spaces on the grid with their respective symbols, usually 'X' and 'O'.
The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

I've included some cool features in this game:

- An interactive game board that responds to your clicks
- Play against a friend in the player vs. player mode
- (Optional) Challenge the AI and play against the computer
- Automatic win detection and end game condition
- Keep track of scores to see who's the ultimate Tic Tac Toe champion!

## Components

Let me give you a brief overview of the different components that make up this game:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the game board and UI elements.
- `css/index.css`: The CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `js/types.js`: Contains TypeScript type definitions for the game.
- `js/store.js`: Manages the game state, including the board, players, and score.
- `js/view.js`: Handles rendering the game board and UI.
- `js/app.js`: Initializes the game and handles user input.
